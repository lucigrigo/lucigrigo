### Hi ðŸ‘‹
*Lucian here*

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on surviving while getting things done
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science (this is what I want to get done :smirk:)

*What I'm up to right now:* learning ML and doing my best to make my work as signifiant as possible

*Here's some of my work:*
